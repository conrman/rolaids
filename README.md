Gulp Starter is a delicious blend of tasks and build tools poured into [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to form a full-featured modern asset pipeline. It can be used as-is as a static site builder, or can be configured and integrated into your own development environment and site or app structure. Checkout [`gulpfile.js/extras`](/gulpfile.js/extras) for Rails and Craft configurations.
